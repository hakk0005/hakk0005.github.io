# Challenges I Faced During The Final.
First it was the override Bootstrap CSS, so I tried to give the elements new classes and make the changes. Although it worked, but it took a lot of time to override the styles. 

Second, I had some issues with the background image, it was only showing when I open the live server, and it disappears when I open the actual link. Thanks to my professor he helped me with fixing the issue. 

## What I learned from by creating the portfolio.
I learned that I really like web development. I tried using everything we learned so far in the portfolio, and it is amazing to see and actually notice the difference between using grid, flex at the biggening of the semester and now! Such a huge difference!
