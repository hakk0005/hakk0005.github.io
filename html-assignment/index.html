                Hello everyone!<br> My name is <em>Dina Hakki</em>, I am 22 years old. After I graduated from high
                school in Syria three years ago, I moved to Canada in March <sup>12</sup>, 2018 to pursue further
                learning. I currently work in customer services, which means <strong>I love to talk to people!</strong>
                I am the type of a person that likes to stay motivated and motivate people around me too. I truley
                believe that maintaining my positive energy is what makes me encourage people around me. I also consider
                myself to be a curious individual. When I come across something that sparks my interest, I dig deeper
                and look more into it.
            </p>

                <h3>My Interest In <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr></h3>
                <p>
                    I took an English course in the Academic Upgrading Program At Algonquin College, So I can apply to
                    <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. <br>
                    My interest in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> sparked when i met a friend that
                    workes in web development and create logos. From there I decided to take some online courses in that
                    field. I had a blast learning about <mark>HTML</mark> and <mark>Illustrator</mark>. Unfortunately,I
                    was unable to complete those courses. Therefore, i decided to enroll in this wonderful program.<br>
                    My dream job would be to work at <b>Apple</b> as part of their design group. I have no doubts that
                    this program will provide me with the appropriate knowladge and experience to land me my dream job.
